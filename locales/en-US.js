    "Ganoderma lucidum is an immortal grass for all kinds of illness and resurrecting the dead in Chinese myths and legends. Historic relics unearthed, such as the brick carvings decorated with Ganoderma lucidum from the North Song Dynasty and the Celadon Vase decorated with Ganoderma lucidum from the South Song Dynasty, all witness the long-standing culture of Longquan Ganoderma lucidum. With its terrific ecological resources, a forest coverage rate of 84.2%, suitable climate and soil conditions, Longquan is ideal for the growth of Ganoderma lucidum. Cultivation Techniques passed down from ancient times bring in better quality Ganoderma lucidum, which makes Longquan worthy of the reputation of the First Ganoderma Town in China.",
